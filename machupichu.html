        <h1>Machu Picchu one of the 7 Wonders of the World</h1><br>
        <p>On July 7, 2007, Machu Picchu was elected one of the New 7 Wonders of the Modern World. More than 100 million
            people from all over the world participated in this election, through an open online vote. The wonders were
            released in random order by the New Open World Corporation (NOWC). Know details of this choice of Machu
            Picchu. Also discover some of his most important awards.

        <p>Machu Picchu, also spelled "Machupijchu", site of ancient Inca ruins located about 50 miles (80 km) northwest
            of Cuzco, Peru, in the Cordillera de Vilcabamba of the Andes Mountains. It is perched above the Urubamba
            River valley in a narrow saddle between two sharp peaks—Machu Picchu (“Old Peak”) and Huayna Picchu (“New
            Peak”)—at an elevation of 7,710 feet (2,350 metres). One of the few major pre-Columbian ruins found nearly
            intact, Machu Picchu was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1983.</p><br>

        <p>Machu Picchu is the most economically important tourist attraction in Peru, bringing in visitors from around
            the world. For this reason the Peruvian government wishes to repatriate the materials taken by Bingham to
            Yale. The ruins are commonly reached in a day trip from Cuzco by first taking a narrow-gauge railway and
            then ascending nearly 1,640 feet (500 metres) from the Urubamba River valley on a serpentine road. Smaller
            numbers of visitors arrive by hiking the Inca Trail. The portion of the trail from the “km 88” train stop to
            Machu Picchu is normally hiked in three to six days. It is composed of several thousand stone-cut steps,
            numerous high retaining walls, tunnels, and other feats of classical engineering; the route traverses a wide
            range of elevations between about 8,530 and 13,780 feet (2,600 and 4,200 metres), and it is lined with Inca
            ruins of various types and sizes.</p><br>

        <p>Built around mid 15th century, Machu Picchu is one of the most famous archeological sites on the planet.
            Located at the highs of the Andes mountains, the engineering marvel holds high cultural significance in the
            country. A perfect example of Inca civilization engineering skills, the structure is made with exceptional
            cut stones which stood earthquakes for more than 500 years. The archeological mystery is the top tourist
            destination to date.</p>
