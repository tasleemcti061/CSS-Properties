        <h1>Chichen Itza one of the 7 Wonders of the World</h1><br>
        <p>Chichen Itza is one of the Seven Wonders of the World and is a historic site situated in Yucatan, Mexico.
            While most people realize that Chichen Itza was built by the Mayans thousands of years ago, there are many
            things tourists don't realize about this marvelous attraction. Chichen Itza refers to an archeological site,
            not the pyramid within it, which is the site's most popular tourist attraction. The pyramid itself was built
            to serve as a temple and a castle and is known as El Castillo - and there is a whole lot more that you may
            want to know about both the site and the pyramid before you visit. </p><br>
        <h2>There Was A Death At The Itza:</h2>
        <p>Tourists at the Chichen Itza are frequently disappointed to know that they cannot climb to the top of the
            pyramid, and here is why. Until 2006, tourists were allowed to climb to the top of El Castillo to gaze upon
            the sculptures at the top. That was until an American tourist stumbled on her way down and fell to her
            death. These accidents are increasingly common and for this reason, the steps of El Castillo are restricted.
            In addition to providing an added layer of safety to tourists, this ensures the structure will not be
            damaged by the feet of hundreds of thousands of tourists climbing the steps.</p><br>
        <h2>Chichen Itza's Glory Declined Mysteriously:</h2>
        <p>This once great empire met its sudden doom when the Mayans who once inhabited this land mysteriously left in
            the 14th century and never returned to it once again. The Chichen Itza was a symbol of perseverance and
            power to the Mayans who had moved around, ravaged by warfare until settling in the Itza, and their
            civilization was one of the most advanced of its time, but it met its sudden end due to a series of issues
            such as drought and famine. After the fall of Chichen Itza, the Mayans persevered in the North till the 16th
            century.</p><br>
        <h2>It Was Discovered Twice:</h2>
        <p>One thing most people do not know about Chichen Itza is that it was discovered twice. In 514 AD, a priest by
            the name of Lakin Chan discovered the site that is known as Chichen Itza. It is believed that Chan was also
            referred to as Itzamna. Chichen Itza translates as “at the mouth of the well of the Itza.” Over the years,
            following its abandonment, Chichen Itza was lost and Mexico fell into turmoil and was ravaged by a series of
            wars. In 1841, American Explorer John Lloyd Stephens stumbled upon this site once again and turned it over
            to Mexico.</p>
