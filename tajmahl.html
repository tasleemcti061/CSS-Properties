        <h1> Tajmahal one of the 7 Wonders of the World</h1><br>

        <p >      One of the seven wonders of the world, Taj Mahal is located on the banks of River Yamuna in Agra. It was
            built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan as a memorial for his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal. It also houses the
            tomb of Shah Jahan himself. Constructed entirely out of white marble in the 17th century, Taj Mahal is one
            of the most beautiful monuments in the world. Every year visitors numbering more than the entire population
            of Agra pass through the magnificent gates to catch a glimpse of this breathtaking monument!</p><br><br>

           <p>
                    A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Taj Mahal stands for the Crown of Palaces in the Persian language. The
            tomb is laid out in a rectangular shape and can be approached through a massive gateway which has an arch
            and alcoves on either side of it. There are water channels and fountains in the entrance which makes the
            monument even more spectacular. The reflection of this majestic spectacle in the Yamuna is almost poetic in
            its perfection!</p><br><br>

            <p>        Covering an area of approximately 42 Acres, the construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1631 and it took 17
            years before it was completed in 1648! It was constructed using white marble obtained from Makrana in
            Rajasthan.  <a href="nyt view.html">Night View</a> </p><br>
