        <h1>Colosseum one of the 7 Wonders of the World</h1><br>
        <p>The Colosseum, otherwise known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of Rome,
            Italy. It is one of the largest and most iconic ancient Roman structures still standing today. Although it
            is commonly thought of as a perfect circle, this is not the case. If you were to look at the Colosseum from
            above, you would see that it is actually an ellipse, with its long axis measuring 156 metres and its short
            axis measuring 156 metres. </p><br>
        <p>A circular structure in Rome, Italy is, in fact, not a circle at all. Because the Colosseum is shaped like an
            elliptical, it is far more difficult to construct than a circle.</p><br>
        <p>Rome's Colosseum is one of the most recognizable structures on the planet. This building, which was built
            during the Roman Empire, once hosted a variety of historic performances. The once-grand stadium has recently
            had some difficulties, resulting in the collapse of parts of it. A major earthquake in 1349 caused severe
            damage to the south side, which ultimately collapsed. Pope Benedict XIV declared it to be a sacred site
            between the ages of 16 and 17th centuries.</p><br>
        <p>The Colosseum in Italy was built in 70 and 80 AD and was the largest amphitheater in the world. This
            magnificent structure is made of concrete and stone and is considered one of the greatest achievements
            of Roman architecture.</p><br>
        <p>Every year, millions of tourists visit the Colosseum to see its grandeur for themselves. It measures 620 by
            513 feet, which is larger than an American football field! It is also estimated that over 50,000 people
            could be seated in the Colosseum at one time.</p><br>

        <p>The Colosseum was used for gladiator fights and public spectacles such as mock sea battles, animal hunts,
            executions, and re-enactments of famous battles and dramas. On average, it is estimated that 550,000 people
            were killed in the Colosseum, and so many animals died that some species even became extinct.</p>
