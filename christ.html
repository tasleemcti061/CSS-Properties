        <h4>CHRIST THE REDEEMER</h4>

    <h1>Christ The Redeemer one of the 7 Wonders of the World</h1><br>
    <p>Today, Christ the Redeemer is one of the seven new wonders of the world, a title recently given to 7 world
        monuments to reflect the list of 7 ancient wonders. It is also the most famous monument in Brazil, and its
        symbole, such as the Statue of Liberty is for the United States, the Eiffel Tower for France, or the Taj
        Mahal for India.</p><br>

    <p> Christ the Redeemer was built using reinforced concrete and has an outer shell of 6 million soapstone tiles.
        It's believed that the workers who made these tiles occasionally wrote notes on the back, meaning this
        iconic landmark is full of hidden messages.</p><br>

    <p>Christ the Redeemer is made of concrete and covered in soapstone tiles. The material for the statue was
        transported up Mount Corcovado which is approximately 2,310 feet above sea level. Once the statue was
        completed, it was 98 feet (30 meters) in height. When measuring across from Christ the Redeemer's
        outstretched arms, it has a width of 92 feet (28 meters).</p><br>

    <p> Christ the Redeemer was not actually built in Brazil. It was first made in France by French sculptor Paul
        Landowski who created the statue in clay pieces. These were then shipped to Brazil to be remade with reinforced
        concrete by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa and French engineer Albert Caquot.</p><br>

    <p>Christ the Redeemer gazes from its perch on Mount Corcovado over the city of Rio de Janeiro in the South
        American country of Brazil. Work began on the colossal Art Deco Style statue in 1922. Art Deco was a popular
        movement in the 1920s characterized by geometric and curvilinear designs and tended to be linear and smooth
        in nature.</p><br>
