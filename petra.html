        <h1>Petra one of the 7 Wonders of the World</h1><br>
        <p>Petra was named as one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in 2007, and fully deserves its place on this
            prestigious list. It shares the accolade with other breath-taking historical sites such as the Great Wall of
            China, Machu Picchu, the Taj Mahal, the Colosseum, Chichen Itza, and the statue of Christ the Redeemer in
            Brazil.

        <h2>"It's also a UNESCO World Heritage site"</h2><br>
        <p>The Petra Archaeological Park is one of five UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Jordan, and the most famous
            tourist attraction in the country.</p><br>
        <h2>"The name 'Petra' means rock's"</h2><br>
        <p>Appropriately, for a city hewn from stone, the name Petra actually means 'rocks'. It is thought to come
            from the Greek word 'Petros', meaning rock, and was named by Greek visitors for its distinctive carved
            sandstone.</p>
        <p>Petra is an important part of Jordan’s cultural heritage, and features on most travel bucket lists – with
            good reason! With intricately carved monuments, labyrinthine passageways and a mysterious history, this
            ancient city remains one of the most beautiful and enigmatic places in the Middle East. It also holds plenty
            of secrets yet to be discovered, so unleash your inner Indiana Jones and start exploring! Here are some of
            my favourite fascinating facts about Petra in Jordan.</p>
